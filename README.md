Epoch 4/10: Loss: 0.9071, Accuracy: 68.70%
Epoch 5/10: Loss: 0.8416, Accuracy: 70.97%
Epoch 6/10: Loss: 0.7847, Accuracy: 72.62%
Epoch 7/10: Loss: 0.7350, Accuracy: 74.48%
Epoch 8/10: Loss: 0.6941, Accuracy: 75.74%
Epoch 9/10: Loss: 0.6516, Accuracy: 77.31%
Epoch 10/10: Loss: 0.6187, Accuracy: 78.36%
Observations

After 5 epochs, the CNN achieved a notable accuracy improvement, reaching around 70%. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in image classification tasks, particularly for handwritten digit recognition. Additionally, the CNN's computational efficiency is enhanced by max-pooling, which reduces image dimensions while preserving essential features.
